"Come look at this! They're really blue!" A UD student beckoned her friend to the bucket housing "Billy Blue," our live blue crab on display at Coast Day 2024, and his pet snail. The entire Birkenbach-Oremus Lab participated in the annual event in Lewes, DE, helping kids and adults alike through maze activities illustrating the crab life cycle within Delaware Bay. While many visitors to our table had ample experience catching and/or eating blue crabs, others found the meat insufficient to be worth the work and didn't understand the fuss. All left knowing how to tell male and female crabs apart based on their undersides ("Washington monument" versus "Capitol Hill," respectively) and claw coloring ("the female paints her nails"), and **Seleni Cruz** did a fantastic job explaining her Sea Grant-funded research to inquisitive passersby. We enjoyed the lovely weather and had fun both teaching and learning about our local marine environment!
