Recent MPP grad **Ben Hurley** has published the first paper to come out of his master's thesis in the journal _Animal Frontiers_! The paper, [https://doi.org/10.1093/af/vfae016](Testing the waters: the state of U.S. shellfish permitting regulations), considers recent developments and future directions in the regulatory space surrounding shellfish aquaculture in the United States. Permitting and regulatory hurdles are still cited as major barriers to aquaculture expansion, but tradeoffs between regulatory efficiency/economic outcomes and environmental oversight still need to be resolved in this nascent industry. **Drs. Birkenbach and Oremus** co-authored the paper with Ben and are proud of his achievement! Stay tuned for more to come!
