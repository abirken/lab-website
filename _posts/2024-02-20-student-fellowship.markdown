Congratulations to **Seleni Cruz**, who is a 2024-2025 recipient of the University of Delaware's Doctoral Fellowship for Excellence! This competitive award recognizes the top Ph.D. students from across the university, based on nominations from graduate programs and recommendations from a committee of faculty reviewers. 

Seleni's doctoral research is focused on understanding how artisanal, small-scale fishing communities in Latin America respond to climate shocks and what these adaptive behaviors mean for policy development aimed at enhancing social welfare.
