*By: **Seleni Cruz**, Environmental Economics PhD candidate*

I am thrilled to share my experience presenting at the International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade (IIFET) conference in Penang, Malaysia. This biennial event brought together researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders from around the world to discuss pressing issues related to fisheries and aquaculture economics and trade. The theme of this yearâ€™s conference, "Aquatic Food Systems in the Blue Economy," perfectly captured the complex interplay between sustainability, economic development, and social equity that defines our field today.

In addition to the insightful discussions, it was the perfect opportunity to indulge in the amazing cuisine of Southeast Asia, enjoy some time on tropical beaches, and drink plenty of coconut water, which is a personal favorite.

**Conference Highlights**
The conference featured a diverse array of presentations, alongside several thought-provoking keynotes and plenary sessions. One highlight was Dr. Shakuntala Thilsted's keynote address, in which the 2021 World Food Prize Laureate introduced the concept of nutrition-sensitive aquatic food systems. This session set the stage for dynamic discussions on how fisheries and aquaculture can contribute to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals.
Outside the conference rooms, the atmosphere was vibrant, with conversations buzzing in several languages over coffee and delicious food. The event provided a wonderful opportunity to reconnect with friends, put faces to names of people I had only met virtually, and establish new connections with colleagues from around the world.

**My Presentation**
I had the opportunity to present my job market paper, "ENSO and Diversification: Evidence from Small-Scale Fisheries in Mexico." My work focuses on how communities adapt fishing and labor allocation decisions in the face of climatic shocks like ENSO. I shared the session with several incredible colleagues, including Silvia Salas and Matt Reimer. The audience was filled with familiar and friendly faces, which certainly helped ease my nerves. This was the first time I presented my job market paper at a larger conference, and I could not have asked for a better turnout and feedback.

**Pre-Conference Workshop on Integrating Gender into Fisheries and Aquaculture Research**
Before the conference officially began, I attended a workshop on integrating gender perspectives into fisheries and aquaculture economics and trade research. Facilitated by experts from institutions like the University of California-Irvine, the Asian Institute of Technology, and the Stockholm Environment Institute, this workshop was a valuable opportunity to deepen my understanding of how gender structures economies and influences economic research and policy. The often-overlooked contributions of women in fisheries and aquaculture took center stage at the workshop. We discussed the need for more inclusive economic research that considers the diverse experiences and challenges faced by women in these sectors.

Overall, my experience at the IIFET conference was incredibly enriching. As a student, being able to attend these types of conferences is truly invaluable for shaping how I conduct and discuss my research, ensuring it remains relevant to real-world issues. I look forward to attending the IIFET conference 2026 in the Faroe Islands and continuing to build on the connections made in Penang!
