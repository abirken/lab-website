**Dr. Anna Birkenbach** joins the [Northeast U.S. Climate Integrated Modeling (NCLIM) Initiative](https://gmri.org/projects/northeast-climate-integrated-modeling-nclim/) as co-PI on a [newly awarded](https://cpo.noaa.gov/funded_projects/nclim-2-northeast-u-s-climate-integrated-modeling-initiative-to-meet-ocean-decision-challenges/) NOAA Climate and Fisheries Adaptation (CAFA) grant. Dr. Birkenbach and a multi-disciplinary team of researchers from the University of Maine, Gulf of Maine Research Institute, Rutgers University, University of Massachusetts - Dartmouth, and NOAA will develop tools to inform marine resource decision-making under projected climate change in the Northeast U.S. shelf ecosystem. 

The CAFA Program is a partnership between the NOAA Research Climate Program Office and the NOAA Fisheries Office of Science and Technology that supports "targeted research to promote adaptation and resilience of the nationâ€™s valuable fisheries and fisheries-dependent communities in a changing climate."

NCLIM is one of just five national projects focused on climate-integrated modeling and the only one focused on the Northeast. Under the new $1.2 million grant, the NCLIM team will test climate adaptation strategies and their socioeconomic impacts by: 1) linking climate, ecosystem, and human dimensions models, 2) simulation testing the performance of climate adaptation strategies, and 3) developing models to support climate adaptation scenarios. Dr. Birkenbach will model the [fishing fleet's behavioral responses](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/727356) to climate-induced changes to the abundance and distribution of fish stocks in the region, along with community-level impacts that may result from redistribution of landings.

Jon Hare, the director of the NOAA Fisheries Northeast Fisheries Science Center said: "The NCLIM project will develop and test the next generation of tools we need for effective fisheries management in a changing climate. NOAA Fisheries is very pleased to partner with the multidisciplinary NCLIM team to advance climate-informed stock assessments and adaptation strategies to support sustainable fisheries and fishing communities in the Northeast."
