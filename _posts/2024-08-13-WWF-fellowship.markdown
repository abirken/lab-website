Congratulations to PhD candidate **Seleni Cruz**, who is a new recipient of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF)'s [Russell E. Train Education for Nature (EFN) Program Fellowship](https://www.worldwildlife.org/projects/russell-e-train-fellowships)! Seleni joins nearly 60 other fellows from 26 countries in the 2024 EFN cohort, the largest in the 30-year history of the Program. Description below:

>"The aim of the Food Systems Fellowship is to support outstanding master's or doctoral students to develop evidence-based, innovative, and interdisciplinary research on food systems at the national level to catalyze the process of generating an improved understanding of the country-specific nature of food systems and transformation. Fellows will also have an opportunity to join the expansive global community of EFN alumni to enable knowledge exchange and collective success."

Support from this fellowship will help expand the depth and reach of Seleni's research, which explores how small-scale fishing operations and the species they rely on respond to climate shocks. The broad range of species and community types she is studying can yield insights not only for her country of focus, but also for geographically and ecologically comparable settings that may display similar adaptive strategies. Well done, Seleni!
