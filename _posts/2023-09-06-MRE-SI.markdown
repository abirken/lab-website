Dr. Birkenbach, along with two colleagues at the University of Stavanger, served as guest editors on a special issue of _Marine Resource Economics_ called "The Economics of Coastal Communities." The issue received over 40 submissions, 4 of which made the final cut for inclusion, and is intended to emphasize lesser-known or understudied connections between marine resources and the communities that rely on them. The selected articles and [accompanying introduction by the editors](https://doi.org/10.1086/726262) also reflect calls from resource managers, government agences, and other entities around the globe for greater attention to these issues among researchers across disciplines. 

The full issue can be accessed [here](journals.uchicago.edu/toc/mre/2023/38/4).
