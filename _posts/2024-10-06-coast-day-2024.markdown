"Come look at this! They're really blue!" A UD student beckoned her friend to the bucket housing "Billy Blue," our live blue crab on display at Coast Day 2024, and his pet snail. The entire lab participated in the annual event in Lewes, DE, helping kids and adults alike through maze activities illustrating the crab lifecycle and movement around the Delaware Bay. While many visitors to our table had ample experience fishing for and/or eating blue crabs, others commented that the meat was insufficient to be worth the work and didn't understand the fuss. Either way, they left with the knowledge of how to tell male and female crabs apart based on their undersides ("Washington monument" versus "Capitol Hill," respectively) and front claw coloring ("the female paints her nails red"). **Seleni Cruz** did a fantastic job sharing her research and findings with inquisitive passersby. We enjoyed the lovely weather and had fun both teaching and learning about our local marine environment!
