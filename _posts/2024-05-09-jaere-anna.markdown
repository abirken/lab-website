**Dr. Birkenbach** and co-authors Min-Yang Lee and Martin D. Smith just published "Counterfactual Modeling of Multispecies Fisheries Outcomes under Market-Based Regulation" in the *Journal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists*, the culmination of a project that began years ago with the support of the NMFS/Sea Grant Fellowship in Marine Resource Economics. Dr. Birkenbach led the development of the Multispecies Intra-Seasonal Targeting/timing Choice (MISTIC) model and estimation of structural parameters that allow for the prediction of individual fisher choices as to what and when to fish. The paper uses the New England groundfish fishery as its empirical application and provides a counterfactual analysis of how fisher choices and their aggregate outcomes would have differed if the fishery had not transitioned to quota/catch share management. Beyond this paper, the MISTIC model has the potential to serve as a tool that can inform management decisions by predicting behavioral responses to policy or environmental changes that have not yet occured. A number of follow-up projects with collaborators at NOAA, the Gulf of Maine Research Institute (GMRI), and other universities are already underway. Stay tuned!
