subtitle:  	Study explores mistreatment of on-board fishery observers
---
Fishery observers play a critical role in managing and conserving fish stocks in the United States and around the world. All too commonly, however, they are hindered in the performance of their duties by mistreatment aboard fishing vessels. Using data from several of the most important U.S. commercial fisheries, authors **Jessica L. Dobson** (former master's student), **Matthew R. Kahley** (former master's student and active U.S. Coast Guard officer), **Anna M. Birkenbach**, and **Kimberly L. Oremus** explore the extent of observer harassment, assault, interference, and obstruction (OHAIO). As the [_Frontiers in Marine Science_ article](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2023.1232642) reports, 16% of 10,346 fishery violations reported in the Northeast and Alaska regions from 2014-2018 were observer-related, and over 80% of those involved OHAIO. The paper discusses barriers to the reporting and processing of  OHAIO incidents and proposes steps to mitigate these issues, drawing on lessons learned from the data analysis and comparisons across the two fishing regions.
